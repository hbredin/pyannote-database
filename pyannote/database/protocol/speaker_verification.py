    docstring template. below is what used to be part of the 
    docstring of xxxx_trial methods.

    Each trial is yielded as a dictionary with the following keys:

    ['reference'] (`boolean`)
        Groundtruth: True for a target trial, False for a non-target trial.

    ['file{1|2}'] (`dict`)
        Both parts of the trial are provided as dictionaries with the
        following keys (as well as keys added by preprocessors):

        ['uri'] (`str`)
            Unique file identifier.

        ['try_with'] (`pyannote.core.{Segment|Timeline}`), optional
            Part(s) of the file to use in the trial. Default is to use the
            whole file.
